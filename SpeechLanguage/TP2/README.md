MVA - Algorithms for Speech and NLP TD 2 (NLP)
========================================

## Running the code

Please make sure you have the polyglot corpus in `system/data/`.
You can run the parser by launching `run.sh` and then writing sentences.
Or you can:
```python system/parser.py -d DATABASE -s SENTENCE```
where DATABASE is the path to the SEQUOIA file and SENTENCE is the sentence you want to parse.

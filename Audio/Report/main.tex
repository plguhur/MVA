\begin{abstract}
    Given a mixture of signals, source separation aims at finding each of the original signal.
    Music is one of the important application field of source separation, as each instrument has a specific signature. 
    However, the challenge remains open. Neural networks seem promising to classify short term audio samples among a panel of given instruments. 
    A deep analysis of the audio properties provide a clearer understanding of required pre-processing steps.

Further improvements: training all 4 instruments at the same time, changing the window, conv on STFT, data augmentation, weights initialization

While the ideas of using MLP and RNN for music-based applications were already proposed  by Todd \cite{Todd1988} and Lewis \cite{Lewis1988} in 1988,  music source separation became particularly popular from 2014 thanks to the ``Singing Voice Separation" challenge proposed by MIREX.



Chandna et al. \cite{chandna2017monoaural} are using a convolutional neural network between the time $\tau$ and the frequency $f$.

Time frequency masking



Let the neural network discovers more invariances in data structures thanks to data augmentation/data generation.

    "Generative modelling in machine learning can aim at achieving different goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, obvious one is that a generative model can be used to generate more data, to be used afterwards by an other algorithm. While a generative model cannot create more information to solve the issue of having too small datasets, it could be used to solve anonymity questions. Typically, sharing a generative model trained on private data could allow the exploitation of the statistical property of this data without sharing the data itself (which can be protected by privacy matters for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another goal is to use generative modelling to better understand the data at hand. This is based on the hypothesis that a model that successfully learned to generate (and generalize) a dataset should have internally learned some efficient and compressed representation of the information contained in the data. In this case, analysing a posteriori the learned representation may give us insights on the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of a generative model however needs to be more formally specified, in order to work with. What does it mean for the model to generate data that \"looks like\" the original dataset? A mathematical formulation of that is necessary, in order to define a training objective that can be used efficiently. Having some expert rate the quality of all generated datapoints one by one is definitely not an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, modelling our data and models as probability distributions comes to the rescue. If we consider our data as coming from some underlying probability distribution, that we will name $p_D$, our goal is thus to train our model to represent another probability distribution, which we will name $p_\\theta$, that should be some good approximation of $p_D$. Given we only know $p_D$ through some set of realisations from it (the dataset), we can never hope to learn it exactly."

The function $f_\\theta$ is implemented as a neural network, $\\theta$ representing its learned parameters."

Such a model seems to need a comparison method based on samples to be trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smart idea of GANs is to instead use another neural network to model the objective. Another neural network is introduced: a classifier (that we call the discriminator) which is trained to differentiate examples from the dataset from examples generated by $p_\\theta$. The reasoning is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator (whose output is denoted by $D(x)$) is trained using a classic discrimination loss, so that $D(x)$ can be interpreted as the probability that $x$ came from the real dataset:\n",

    "$$ \\mathcal{L}_D = 2 \\left( \\log 2 - JSD(p_\\theta \\| p_D) \\right) $$\n",

    "When representing a binary classifier with a neural network, it is better for the last layer to consist of only a sigmoid activation, so that the output values will be between 0 and 1 and stand for the probability (according to the classifier) that the input is of the first class. The output is thus of the form $\\mathrm{sigmoid}(h)$. The loss involves quantities such as $-\\log(\\mathrm{sigmoid}(h))$. For numerical stability reasons, it is recommended to rewrite the loss in order to make use of the $\\mathrm{softplus}$ function defined by $\\mathrm{softplus}(h) = \\log(1 + \\exp(h))$ and provided in PyTorch as `torch.softplus`.\n",

In this case, the resulting distribution $p_\\theta(x) = \\int_z p_\\theta(x|z)p(z)ds$ is an infinite mixture of gaussians, which is a much more expressive class of distributions.\n",

As such the combination of the last two terms form a lower bound of $\\log p_\\theta(x)$ which *can* be computed and used as a training objective. This bound is called the *Evidence Lower-Bound (ELBO)*. Simply flipping its sign can make it into a loss that can be minimized by gradient descent:\n",

    "From this formulation comes the parallel with auto-encoders that give the VAE its name: $q_\\phi(z | x)$ can be seen as a *probabilistic encoder* from the data $x$ to the latent space $z$, and $p_\\theta(x | z)$ can be seen as a *probabilistic decoder* from the latent space $z$ to the data $x$. In this case the second term of $\\mathcal{L}_{ELBO}$ is the loss measuring the reconstruction quality of the auto-encoder, and the first term can be seens as a regularization of the latent space."
